# Privacy Policy for Reference Check

Last updated: _Nov 19, 2024_

## Introduction

Reference Check (the "Add-On") is designed to enhance your experience with Google Workspace. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any data you share.

## Information We Collect

The Add-On may access and process the following information to function correctly:

- **User Data**: Data directly provided by the user or data explicitly authorized by the user in the context of the add-on's operations.
- **Google Workspace Data**: The Add-On may access Google Workspace data (i.e., Google Sheets) only with the permissions you explicitly grant. We do not store, share, or sell your data.

## How We Use Information

The information accessed by the Add-On is used solely to provide the intended functionality, such as:

- Navigating within the Sheet

We do not store, share, or use your data for any other purpose.

## Data Storage and Security

The Add-On does not store your data outside of Google's services. We follow best practices to ensure data security, and any temporary data used within the Add-On is deleted immediately after processing.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties except as required by law or with your explicit consent.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated date.
