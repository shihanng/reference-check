# Reference Check

Reference Check is an add-on for Google Sheets that provides a simple feature of Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents in Excel. Given a selected cell, this add-on shows the cells referenced by the selected cell and those referencing it. Users can also navigate between the precedent and dependent cells.
